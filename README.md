# Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Evolution Across Species

This project is part of the BioinformHER Module 2 Mini-Project. It explores the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across selected species using bioinformatics tools.
## üî¨ Objective

To analyze the HBB gene from *Homo sapiens* and investigate its evolutionary conservation across five other species using sequence alignment and phylogenetic methods.
## üìå Tasks Completed

1. Retrieved HBB sequences using NCBI BLAST.
2. Performed pairwise alignment with EMBOSS Needle.
3. Created Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Clustal Omega.
4. Generated a sequence logo with Skylign.
5. Built a phylogenetic tree using MEGA X.

## üßæ Requirements

- [NCBI BLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- [EMBOSS Needle](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_needle)
- [Clustal Omega](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
- [Skylign](http://skylign.org/)
- [MEGA X](https://www.megasoftware.net/)

## üß™ Key Findings

- Mouse (*Mus musculus*) is most closely related to human based on HBB sequence (80.3% identity).
- Birds (*Anas flavirostris oxyptera*, *Troglodytes aedon*) are more distantly related.
- Highly conserved residues were identified at functional sites of the HBB protein.
- The phylogenetic tree matches expected evolutionary relationships.

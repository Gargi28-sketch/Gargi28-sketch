👋 Hi, I’m Gargi Durbude
👀 I’m interested in computational biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and the integration of AI in healthcare and drug discovery — especially combining wet lab and dry lab approaches. I’m also passionate about computational genomics, proteomics, and functional genomics
🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring AI/ML and Bioinformatics
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML-based projects in disease prediction, biomarker discovery, antimicrobial resistance studies, cancer genomics, and other bioinformatics-driven research
📫 How to reach me: gauridilip2001@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I love decoding genomes as much as solving puzzles — and can switch from scripting in Python to culturing bacteria without missing a beat!
